            Hey! I'm <b>Raine Jacob</b> — a curious mind with a passion for{" "}
            <b>data, design, and discovery</b>.<br />
            <br />I graduated with a <b>BCA</b> degree and have been diving deep
            into the world of <b>data analytics</b> ever since. I love exploring
            patterns in data, building sleek dashboards, and translating numbers
            into stories using tools like <b>Python, SQL, Power BI, Excel</b>,
            and <b>Tableau</b>.<br />
            <br />
            Whether it's breaking down business trends or finding hidden
            insights, I'm always up for a challenge. I’ve worked on several
            hands-on projects that reflect my skills and obsession with clean
            visuals and meaningful results.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I’m not analyzing datasets, you’ll probably find me{" "}
            <b>gaming</b>, geeking out over <b>new tech</b>, or learning
            something new just for fun.
            <br />
            <br />
            I’m actively looking for opportunities where I can grow, contribute,
            and collaborate with people who love data as much as I do.
